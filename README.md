**SymDPO: Boosting In-Context Learning of Large Multimodal Models with Symbol Demonstration Direct Preference Optimization** [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11909)] <br>

## 📚 Introduction

As language models continue to scale, **Large Language Models (LLMs)** have exhibited remarkable capabilities in **In-Context Learning (ICL)**, enabling them to solve language tasks by prefixing a few in-context demonstrations (ICDs). Inspired by these advancements, researchers have extended these techniques to **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)** with ICL capabilities.

However, existing LMMs face a critical issue: they often fail to effectively leverage the **visual context** in multimodal demonstrations and instead simply follow textual patterns. This highlights a lack of alignment between multimodal demonstrations and model outputs.

To address this issue, we propose **Symbol Demonstration Direct Preference Optimization (SymDPO)**. SymDPO breaks the traditional paradigm of constructing multimodal demonstrations by replacing text answers in examples with **random symbols**, forcing the model to carefully understand the demonstration images and establish relationships between images and symbols to answer questions correctly.

We validate the effectiveness of SymDPO on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its ability to enhance the multimodal context understanding of LMMs and improve their ability to answer questions accurately.

<!-- ## 🛠️ Features

- **Improved Multimodal Context Alignment**: By substituting text answers with symbols, SymDPO ensures better alignment between visual context and model outputs.
- **Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities**: SymDPO helps LMMs move beyond textual patterns, leveraging visual context more effectively.
- **Proven Effectiveness**: Validated across multiple benchmarks with significant performance improvements.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Here’s how to use the model to inference:

1. Prepare your multimodal examples (including images and text answers).
2. Download the model weights. (The model weights trained with SymDPO will be released soon.)
3. Modify the file paths in `open_flamingo/scripts/inference.py` accordingly.  
4. Run the `inference.py` file to perform inference.
   ```bash
   conda activate SymDPO
   python open_flamingo/scripts/inference.py
   ```
